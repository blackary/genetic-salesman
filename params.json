{"name":"Genetic-salesman","tagline":"Solving the Travelling Salesman Problem with a Greedy Genetic Algorithm","body":"## Traveling Salesman Problem.\r\nIf you have a number of different cities to visit, spread all over the map, how do you find the shortest path from one, to the next, to the next, and finally back to the first city?\r\n\r\nA simple problem with 4 cities, but what about 10? 100?\r\nIf there are _N_ cities, there are _N!_ different paths. \r\nIf N is 30, N! is 30x29x28...x3x2x1 = **2.65x10^32**\r\n\r\n***\r\n## Two Possible Solutions.\r\n* Greedy Algorithm\r\n* Genetic Algorithm\r\n\r\n### Greedy Algorithm\r\nBasic idea: Start with 1 city, find the next closest city, and repeat until you've run out of cities left (then go back to the first)\r\n\r\n**Advantages** Relatively fast algorithm. O(N^2), rather than N! - a significant improvement. Gives a _decent_ solution.\r\n\r\n**Disadvantages** Never gives an ideal solution. Typically the first \"end\" of the path is inefficient. Doesn't consider the \"big picture\".\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
